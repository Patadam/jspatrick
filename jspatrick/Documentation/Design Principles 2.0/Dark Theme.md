# Dark Theme

## Properties
Contrast: Dark surfaces and 100% white body text have a contrast level of at least 15.8:1
Depth: At higher levels of elevation, components express depth by displaying lighter surface colors
Desaturation: Primary colors are desaturated so they pass the Web Content Accessibility Guidelinesâ€™ (WCAG) AA standard of at least 4.5:1 (when used with body text) at all elevation levels
Limited color: Large surfaces use a dark surface color, with limited color accents (light, desaturated and bright, saturated colors)

## Behaviours
Toggle: Dark theme can be toggled on or off using a control, either displayed or in a menu or settings


## Surfaces & Colour
